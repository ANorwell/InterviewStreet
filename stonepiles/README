APPROACH:

This is an impartial game, which are a well-studied class of
game. Sprague-grundy theory gives an algorithm to solve this. See:

http://www.gabrielnivasch.org/fun/combinatorial-games/sprague-grundy

for a very good explanation.

The implementation here is in two steps: For each size 3 <= x <= 50,
we compute the s-g number of a single stone pile of size x. This is
precomputed using gen_grundy.cpp, and hardcoded into stonepiles.cpp
(for speed). The hard work is in generating these values, because it
requires finding all the possible valid moves (i.e. unique splits) of
each pile size.

stone_pile.cpp uses these values to compute the winner of given board
positions.
