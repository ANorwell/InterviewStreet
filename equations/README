APPROACH:

1/x + 1/y = 1/N! iff y = N!(N!+d)/d (where x = N! + d). In other
words, an integer d gives a solution if and only d divides
(N!)^2. Hence, we wish to calculate the number of factors of (N!)^2.

This code does this naively by calculating a list of primes, and using
that to find the divisors of every number between 1 and N. To speed up
this process, we only find a sigle factor for each number, and save
that factor as well as the dividend. This memoized structure can later
be used to find all the factors of any number.
